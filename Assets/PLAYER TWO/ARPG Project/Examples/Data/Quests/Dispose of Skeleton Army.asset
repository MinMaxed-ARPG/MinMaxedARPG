  description: "Captain Elira and her squad fought off a large group of undead skeletons

  startDialogue: "The eastern path to the city \u2014 it\u2019s overrun. Skeletons
    \u2014 dozens of them, maybe more \u2014 clawed their way up from the graves
    like they\u2019d been waiting for this war.\n\nMy men... we fought hard. We cleared
    most of them out, but not without a cost.\n\nSome of us didn\u2019t make it.
    Brave souls, every one of them.\n\nBut there are still stragglers. A few more
    of those bone-walkers holding the road. I need someone to finish what we started.\n\nClear
    the path. Crush every last one of those cursed things. The city needs that road
    open \u2014 and we need to know our dead didn\u2019t fall for nothing."
  completeDialogue: "It\u2019s done, then? They\u2019re gone?\n\nGood. That road\u2019s
    the lifeline to the outer settlements. Trade. Supplies. Reinforcements. You\u2019ve
    done more than kill a few bones, Hero \u2014 you\u2019ve opened the vein that
    keeps this city breathing.\n\nBut mark my words... these dead don\u2019t just
    rise on their own. Someone \u2014 or something \u2014 is stirring them."
