  startDialogue: "The battle... it was a slaughter.\n\nI watched comrades I\u2019ve
    bled beside for years fall beside me. Brave, loyal, unshakable. I buried them
    myself \u2014 I swore they would know peace.\n\nBut peace... is a cruel illusion.\n\nThey\u2019ve
    returned, Hero \u2014 not as the warriors they were, but as hollow, twisted things.
    The underworld has claimed their bodies, raised them into a mockery of life.
    My own soldiers \u2014 turned against the living.\n\nI\u2019m begging you...
    find their remains and lay them to rest. Destroy the magic that binds them to
    this wretched unlife. Only then can their spirits find peace."
  completeDialogue: "It\u2019s done, isn\u2019t it?\n\nWere they... themselves at
    all? Any trace of who they were?\n\nNo. Of course not. That wasn\u2019t them
    \u2014 just their flesh, twisted by some cruel hand.\n\nThank you. You gave them
    the peace I couldn\u2019t. And perhaps... you\u2019ve given me a little of it
    too."
