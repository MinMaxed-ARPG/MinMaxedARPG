  startDialogue: "Ah... you\u2019ve come at a desperate time, friend. The village's
    soldiers lie broken \u2014 their wounds too deep for poultices and prayer alone.\n\nThere
    is... one hope. A sacred plant, lost to time and fear. Lilith's Flowers. A bloom
    said to carry the breath of the gods \u2014 able to seal any wound, no matter
    how cruel.\n\nBut it only grows in cursed soil, where shadows whisper and the
    air forgets warmth.\n\nPlease, brave one \u2014 find these flowers. Bring them
    to me, and I swear, the light will shine on these warriors once more."
  completeDialogue: "By the spirits... is that\u2014? Yes! Lilith\u2019s Flower!\nYou
    found it. Against all odds, you found it.\n\nIts energy... it hums with the power
    of life itself. This will mend wounds no blade or magic could ever touch. You've
    done more than save the soldiers \u2014 you've given this village a future.\n\nMay
    the gods watch over you, as you have watched over us."
