  startDialogue: "Brave one... I come to you not with holy riddles, but with grim
    news.\n\nA company of soldiers was dispatched days ago \u2014 sent to a camp
    near the city to face the horrors rising from the underworld. They were strong,
    steadfast, ready for battle.\n\nBut... we\u2019ve heard nothing since.\n\nNo
    riders. No word. Not even a whisper on the wind.\n\nPlease \u2014 go to the camp.
    See if they still draw breath... or if the darkness has claimed them. Should
    they still stand, they will need your strength. If not... then we will need your
    courage."
  completeDialogue: "You're back... but I see the truth in your silence.\n\nSo they
    are gone. Every soul. Brave hearts, swallowed by the abyss.\n\nThey marched into
    darkness so others could live in the light. Their sacrifice will not be forgotten
    \u2014 not by me, not by the gods.\n\nThank you, Hero. For walking where others
    dared not. You carried their memory home. That, too, is an act of valor."
